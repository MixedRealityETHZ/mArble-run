### Description:
This project implements an interactive mixed-reality marble game designed for the Magic Leap 2 device. Users can create and manipulate virtual marble tracks in the air using the Magic Leap controller, offering a fun and immersive experience.

Key Features:
* Track Creation: Draw virtual tracks in 3D space with the controller, allowing marbles to run down dynamically created paths.
* Track Customization: Place special pre-made blocks like funnels, loopings, and other obstacles to enhance the marble's journey.
* Editing & Deleting: Easily modify or delete parts of the track in real-time, providing flexibility for creative play.
* Immersive Interaction: Use the Magic Leap 2's spatial awareness and controller gestures to interact with the track and marbles in an intuitive mixed-reality environment.

This project showcases the capabilities of spatial computing and brings a playful twist to mixed-reality experiences.
